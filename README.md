Supplementary files and code for Olah et al. 2020 Nature Communications paper

This repository contains two supplementary files from the original publication: the counts table for all cells that passed filtering and were used in the final analysis, and a metadata table of donor and cluster IDs. 
This repository also contains the general workflow coded in R for clustering these cells. Note that this workflow was implemented in Seurat v2 in the paper.
